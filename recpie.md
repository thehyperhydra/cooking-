1. Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)

2. Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)

3. Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.

4. Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.

5. Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.

6. Place them bake on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!
